For each interior gridded point
	Loop through all coastline points in spreadsheet order
		Determine which coastline point is closest to the interior point
		Associate the interior point with the ID of the closest coastline point


When finding distance to coast:
Find the grid points bounding the target point
	Select all grid points with IDs BETWEEN the min and max grid point coastline IDs
	Do the Great Circle calculation between ALL returned points and the target point
	Return the smallest distance to coast(
